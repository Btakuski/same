To-do list for 'same'
=====================

This list is more-or-less in priority order.

 * Remove double entries from the list of input files.

 * Fix bug: some duplicate parts are shown more than once.
   For every match found, perform a 'union' with all earlier matches.
   If a union exists, then replace the earlier match with the union.

 * Specify available filters in properties file, so that filters
   can be written by others too.

 * Print extra statistic: number of lines per second.

 * Print the filter at the beginning of the output.

 * Describe the filters, either in the code, or in a properties file.
   Show in output, and show all descriptions with the usage message.
 
 * Maximum performance.
 
 * Allow filters to have options.
 
 * Some way to allow not-completely-contiguous matches, without a lot of
   performance loss.
 
 * Some way to do approximate matching.
