This file describes the changes made to versions of 'same'.

========

Version 1.2: First open source version.

 * Renamed tool from 'duploc' to 'same', because a tool named 'duploc' with
   similar functionality already exists.
 
 * Reorganized the package structure.  The entry point for the command line
   interface is now same.textui.SameCLI.

========

Version 1.1: Some bug fixes, refactoring.

 * Added the 'none' filter, which is now also the default.  This does not
   filter the input at all.

 * Added some more statistics about the matches.

 * Fixed a bug that caused matches to be skipped sometimes.  Unfortunately
   performance suffered.  But:

 * Fixed a bug that caused many comparisons to be done more than once.
   That made performance come back to an acceptable level.

 * Fixed a bug that caused the 'number of filtered lines' to be too
   high.

 * Now uses a 64-bit hash code instead of a 32-bit one.  Does not seem
   to reduce the number of potential matches significantly.

 * Moved all classes from the default package to com.baan.tools.duploc
   and com.baan.tools.test.duploc.

 * Separated the end-user I/O from the functionality.  The entry point
   is now com.baan.tools.duploc.DupLocCLI (was previously DupLoc).
   This step makes it possible to create a new front end, which
   receives events through DupLoc.IListener.

Version 1.0: Initial published version
